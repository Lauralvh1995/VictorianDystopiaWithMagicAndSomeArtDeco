Matriarchial family that heads the military.
They have been around for several centuries, some claiming that they even pre-date [The Day a Star Fell](../../../World/Big%20Events/The%20Day%20a%20Star%20Fell.md).

Their current matriarch is [Nyrele CLXV](Nyrele%20CLXV%20XYZ.md)
Traditionally, the matriarch always changes their name to "Nyrele" upon inheriting the title, even if they were given a different name at birth.
