"Your defeat is not a question of 'If'. It is '*When*'"

AKA "Nyrele of the Many Graves" or "Nyrele of the Thousand Graves" or "Nyrele the Eternal"

The Last Elf. 

When she was young, Nyrele was close with a family of Humans, which was unusual for an Elf. Her blood family called her mad, and eventually cast her out. [The XYZ Family](The%20XYZ%20Family.md) adopted her, and she married a human man by the name of Ansireth. Together they had five children. But as fate would have it, Nyrele would outlive her beloved Ansireth, and their children. She eventually remarried, and remarried, and remarried, and remarried, and remarried, and remarried. All but the last marriage, she would be the only person still living. The family became firmly known for having a large amount of half-elves. This resulted in her becoming the Matriarch of the XYZ family.

After [The Day a Star Fell](../../../World/Big%20Events/The%20Day%20a%20Star%20Fell.md), she saw her own flesh and blood die, year after year. Realising she would be outlived by her human family, she carefully hatched a plan to become Immortal. She did the unthinkable, and bound her soul to a beautiful onyx and placed it into the care of her 7th husband, Istrith. Istrith was to hold on to the gemstone until his old age. They would still be together, if not in physical form. One day, he was to gather a thousand of their most loyal retainers and the strongest daughter of the family. 

That was the day she would return. All but Istrith lost their soul that day, ripped from their bodies, only to fuel the spell that would return Nyrele to the land of the living, in the body of a young woman. Istrith was appalled at what happened and rejected her. Nyrele didn't take well to the rejection of her last love. So she returned to the family, alone, with great, new-found power.

And took control of all of the family, by force.

She is now possessing the 165th daughter of the family since then. And each return would take another thousand souls.
