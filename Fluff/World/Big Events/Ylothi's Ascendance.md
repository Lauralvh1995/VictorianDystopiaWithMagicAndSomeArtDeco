[Ylothi](../Religion/Deities/Ylothi.md) was a young person, striving to create balance in the world.

On one day, they managed to open the way to [The High Heavens](../The%20Otherworlds/The%20High%20Heavens.md) from [The Mortal Realm](../The%20Mortal%20Realm.md), by sacrificing everything material including their body. Their soul was the first to ascend to the Heavens since [The Father Above](../Religion/Deities/The%20Father%20Above.md) and his favoured children left the mortal realm behind.
