1930 Years Ago

One day a Star fell from the sky and changed the fabric of magic all around the world.
As a result, most intelligent species in [The Mortal Realm](../The%20Mortal%20Realm.md) died, leaving only Humans behind.
People may still have some of the other species in their bloodline, but that does not express visually anymore.
