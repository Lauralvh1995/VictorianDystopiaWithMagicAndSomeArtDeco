Everdreamers are people who willingly enter a dream-state to acts as conduits between [The Mortal Realm](The%20Mortal%20Realm.md) and [The Land of Dreams](The%20Land%20of%20Dreams.md)the Land of Dreams]. While in this state, they are between life and death until their souls naturally wither away.

Traditionally they are partially sealed into infused plaster. Their faces are covered up in the process. To the [Church](The%Holy%Ylothian%Church.md) they are considered to have given the ultimate sacrifice. But as they have to turn away from [Ylothi](Ylothi.md)'s salvation to undergo the process, they are to be henceforth be treated as heretics and have their bodies burnt after their souls are gone.

This has lead to some contention between members of the flock, especially after [Heretic-Saint Alonith](Heretic-Saint%20Alonith.md) underwent the process with the intention to try and convert the Fae.
