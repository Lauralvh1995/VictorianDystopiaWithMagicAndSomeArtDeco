Home of the Fae, and the closest to [the Mortal Realm](../The%20Mortal%20Realm.md) of the three Otherworlds.

Fae did not choose either their [Father](../Religion/Deities/The%20Father%20Above.md) or their [Mother](../Religion/Deities/The%20Mother%20Below.md), or loved Them both equally, and thus are barred from both the Heavens and the Hells.

Humans can cross over to this world during their dreams, hence the Land of Dreams

Fae can leave at will, but tend to only do so to enter the dreams of mortals
